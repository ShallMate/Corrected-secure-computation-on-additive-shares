# Corrected-secure-computation-on-additive-shares

We show that the security proof and parameter settings of the secure multi-party computation protocols [IEEE TC, 2021, DOI: 10.1109/TC.2021.3073171] should be corrected, not as claimed. Taking the secure comparison protocol (Algorithm 8 of the original paper) as an example, we resolve the security proof and parameter settings issues.
